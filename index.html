    <p>Hello! I will show you how <strong>easy</strong> it is to grow your own veggies no matter what space you reside in.
        I will go over steps starting with the easy tomato and the herb Basil. Before long, you'll be
        making your own sauce! Lets get started.
    </p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Lets buy some simple ingredients:
                1. A packet of tomato seeds
                2. Solo or styrofoam cups
                3. Scissors
                4. Potting soil
                5. A bottle of water
                6. A small LED lamp/grow light or window sill
                7. Cinnamon (a sprinkle prevents mold)
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Easy Instructions</h2>
            <p>Cut the solo cup or styrofoam cups in half. Fill the half with potting soil.
                Use your index finger to push an indention into the middle of the soil, about 1 inch.
                Open the seeds. Place 1-2 seeds into the hole you made with your finger. Cover with
                more potting soil. Water until soil is damp. NOTE: Sprinkle a small amount of cinnamon over top
                soil to prevent mildew and mold.
                Use a small LED lamp or grow light as the sun source, 
                or set near a window that gets light. Sprouting will take about 2 weeks. 
                Make sure to check every 2 days and water as needed.
            </p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Harvesting</h2>
            <p>Once the plant has grown to about 6 inches, you can transplant it to a larger pot or outside.
                If you are transplanting outside, make sure to harden the plant by placing it outside for a few hours
                a day for a week. This helps the plant adjust to outside elements. 
                Once the plant is ready, you can harvest the tomatoes when they are red and ripe. 
                Enjoy your fresh tomatoes!

            <h2>Growing to Music and Sound</h2>
            <p>Did you know that plants grow better with music? It's true! Plants respond to sound and vibrations.
                They grow faster and healthier when they are exposed to music. 
                Try playing music for your plants and see how they respond. 
                You can also try talking to your plants. They respond to vibrations and sound.

            Using the USDA model, this chart will show the standard by which gardeners and growers can determine which perennial 
            plants are most likely to thrive. The instructions on this page and this zone chart have worked for a variety of vegetable, flower and herb seeds:
            Cucumber, Green beans, Radishes, Snap peas, Tomato, Okra, Zucchini, Yellow Squash, Mini Watermelon,
            Musk Melon, Sunflowers, Petunia, Carrots, Sweet and Purple Basil, Thyme, Italian and Greek Oregano, Rosemary and Sage.
