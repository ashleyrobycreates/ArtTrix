    <h1>Welcome to Five Minute Farms!</h1>
    <p>Here I will show you how easy it is to grow your own veggies no matter what space you reside in.
        I will go over steps starting with the easy tomato and the herb Basil. Before long, you'll be
        making your own sauce! Lets get started.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Getting Started</h2>
    <p>Lets buy some simple ingrediants. 
        1. A packet of tomato seeds.
        2. Solo cups or styrofoam cups
        3. Scissors
        4. Potting soil
        5. A bottle of water
        6. A small LED lamp/grow light.
        7. cinnamon, small bottle
        
    </p>
    <h2>Easy Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        Cut the solo cup or styrofoam cups in half. Fill the half with potting soil.
        Use your index finger to push an indention into the middle of the soil, about 1 inch.
        Open the seeds. Place 1-2 seeds into the hole you made with your finger. Cover with
        more potting soil. Water until soil is damp. NOTE: Sprinkle a small amount of cinnamon over top
        soil to prevent mildew and mold.
        Use a small LED lamp or grow light as the sun source, 
        or set near a window. Sprouting will take about 2 weeks. Make sure to check every 2 days and water with water bottle until
        soil is damp to touch. Congrats! You now have planted your first
        tomato plant!
