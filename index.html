    <h1>Welcome to Five Minute Farms!</h1>
    <p>Hello! I will show you how <strong>easy</strong> it is to grow your own veggies no matter what space you reside in.
        I will go over steps starting with the easy tomato and the herb Basil. Before long, you'll be
        making your own sauce! Lets get started.

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Lets buy some simple ingredients. 
                1. A packet of tomato seeds.
                2. Solo cups or styrofoam cups
                3. Scissors

            <h2>Easy Instructions</h2>
            <p>Cut the solo cup or styrofoam cups in half. Fill the half with potting soil.
                Use your index finger to push an indention into the middle of the soil, about 1 inch.
                Open the seeds. Place 1-2 seeds into the hole you made with your finger. Cover with
                more potting soil. Water until soil is damp. NOTE: Sprinkle a small amount of cinnamon over top
                soil to prevent mildew and mold.
                Use a small LED lamp or grow light as the sun source, 
                or set near a window that gets light. Sprouting will take about 2 weeks. 
                Make sure to check every 2 days and water as needed.
