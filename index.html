    <h2>Easy Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        Cut the solo cup or styrofoam cups in half. Fill the half with potting soil.
        Use your index finger to push an indention into the middle of the soil, about 1 inch.
        Open the seeds. Place 1-2 seeds into the hole you made with your finger. Cover with
        more potting soil. Water until soil is damp. NOTE: Sprinkle a small amount of cinnamon over top
        soil to prevent mildew and mold.
        Use a small LED lamp or grow light as the sun source, 
        or set near a window that gets light. Sprouting will take about 2 weeks. Make sure to check every 2 days and water with water bottle until
        soil is damp to touch. Congrats! You now have planted your first
        tomato plant!
