# Web Development Project
This is my capstone project for CODE:You. The project utilizes a third-party api to retrieve information, that is then presented to the user with a helpful interface. 
The user is able to interact with the information provided by searching for available options. 
The goal of the project is to demonstrate a general knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview
 Hello! Welcome to Five Minute Farms! This website was made to advise anyone, in basic steps, how to grow an easy, small farm. According to my own research and web based research, plants DO respond to music and sounds! For this reason, a Spotify profile media player is included for users to login and play music/soundwaves to help their garden grow healthier and happier. A growth chart is provided to show in days approximately how long it takes to grow from a seedling to "ready to plant" status. Finally, an images page shows various stages of seedlings and gardens. Happy plants = happy harvest!

## Resources
The resources I used for this project are as follows:
- [Third-Party API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)
   - This provides the user the ability to login to their own Spotify Profile.
  [Research] (www.growoya.com)
   -This website provides planting info according to the users zone based on location in the United States.
  [Research] Chart.js (w3schools.com)
   - Growing Chart, based on my own research as a gardener for over five years.
   

### Project Overview
---

The project is organized as follows:

- **Landing Page:** The landing page provides the user with options to navigate the web application, log in and gives an overview of what to expect.

**Spotify Profile API Music Player:** Using the third-party API allows users to link their Spotify profile directly onto the web app page, and consequently play music from their own library for themselves, and for the healthy growth of their seedlings and garden.

**Garden Chart:** Growing chart in days based on seedlings, made based on my own research of over five years.

**Garden Images:** Images have been added that show the various stages of planting and growing.
