# Web Development Project
This is my capstone project for CODE:You. The project utilizes a third-party api to retrieve information, that is then presented to the user with a helpful interface. 
The user is able to interact with the information provided by searching for available options. 
The goal of the project is to demonstrate a general knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview
 Hello! Welcome to Five Minute Farms! This website was made to instruct anyone to make easy, small farms whether located outside or inside. According to my own research and lots of research on the web, plants respond to music and sounds. So, a Spotify media player is also included to play music/sound to help your garden grow healthier and happier. A weather app is also included for checking local weather.

## Resources
The resources I used for this project are as follows:
- [Third-Party API](https://www.weatherapi.com)
    - This provides the weather information seen on the weather forecast page.
- [Third-Party API](https://developer.spotify.com/)
    - This provides the music to be played for the garden.
- [Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
    - The icons in the navigation menu were selected from this resource.


### Project Overview
---

The project is organized as follows:

- **Landing Page:** The landing page provides the user with options to navigate the web application and gives an overview of what to expect.

- **Weather Forecast:** Using the third-party weather api the weather forecast page allows users to search for their weather forecast and view future forecasts.

**Spotify Music Player:** Using the third-party music api allows users to search for various music and sounds to play for their garden.

- **Contact Me:** The contact-me page allows users to fill in a form and submit it. The information from that form will be stored using an external form.
